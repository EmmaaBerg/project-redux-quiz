# Redux quiz group project
This week was a group project with the task to build a quiz game using Redux.

## The problem

We started the week to plan and structure the project on a Jamboard. We decided to go with mob programing since it was the first week of Redux, and it was important for us to make sure that everyone understood and followed the code. 

We had some trouble with getting the buttons for our quiz to be disabled after clicking on them and playing the audio when starting the quiz. We solved the problem with help from StackOverflow.
